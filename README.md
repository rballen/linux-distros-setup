linux-distros-setup
===================
I'm a distro junkie. I boot into 4-5 OS's on my laptop and 4 on my desktop plus numerous vitual machines. These scripts along with my setup allow me to get a distro up and running with minimal impact to my workflow and no loss of data. I used to call this 'the idiots guide to multibooting' cause it was a long hard road to get here. Anyway the key to multiboot and everything really is organization and optimization.

## good examples we should all follow

## Templates
cp this folder to ~/ and update ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Templates"

## config
* bookmarks.xml - my customized radiotray stations - all the fantastique soma.fm and awesome album 88.5 atl
* lighttpd.conf - conf for a great httpsserver
* unity.google.desktop - sometimes i check in on ubuntu

## scripts
